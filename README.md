# Core Java 8
Many developers, including original contributors of the project, prefer to more practical use of new knowledge rather than reading it in a textual form. This project attempts to illustrate core Java concepts in self-explanatory simple code examples. It particularly emphasizes on explaining new features and changes introduced in Java 8. 

# Contribution
Anyone who find if there is missing or incorrect information in code examples are welcome to send their pull requests. As you know, Rome wasn't built in a day.
